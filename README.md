# gMail clone in React with RSBuild compiler

[original wishlist here](https://github.com/Beej126/GmailZero)... geez, has it been 4 years!?! kids just in high school right now, they'z all that matters =)

- generated with VSCode Copilot in `Agent` mode with `Claude 3.7 Sonnet` model
- prompt: `create a react project named "gMaelstrom" that is a gmail clone, typescript build with rsbuild, context data store (no redux), css grid for main page layout, google authentication, and populated with actual user emails from gmail cloud`
  - yes! we don't need CRA anymore ([Rsbuild](https://rsbuild.rs/) seems to be a great replacement)
  - includes typescript syntax checker plugin (see [pluginTypeCheck](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/rsbuild-plugin-type-check) in rsbuild.config.ts)
- this being my first real experience with copilot AI "vibe" style coding was a real treat...
  - created the google auth, main pages, email list & email detail components all without intervention, blew me away...
  - responses included fantastic instructions to create google auth api key which was something i was dreading
  - i had a working react app that loaded my actual emails within a couple hours (admittedly i've been coding a react project at work for 5 years now and have strong familiarity with react paradigm)
  - as i continued to expand into more complex functionality (settings menu, loading complex emails with crazy mime embeded images, dark mode) several things did need some cancel/retry loops with copilot and manual editing

PS- if anyone is out there listening, can we please please please get a big monitor that finally really hits the mark for programmers:

money is no object =) and no, the new LG 49gx950A-B doesn't quite make the cut, too small and not a good panel for text
